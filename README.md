This is a summary of all known research studies in the United States that provide enrolled participants the option to access their own uninterpreted genome sequence data generated as part of the study. 

Limitations of this resource:
- Only includes sequencing based research studies. Does not currently include studies that provide uninterpreted genotype data from microarrays. 
- Focuses only on research studies, not access to genome data from commercial DTC. However, if a research study partners with a commercial company to provide acces to sequencing data, that should qualify.
